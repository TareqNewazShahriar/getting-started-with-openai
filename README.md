To give you an idea of how `temperature` and `Top_p` parameters can be used in different scenarios, hereâ€™s a table with example values:
| Use Case |	Temperature |	Top_p |	Description
|---|--|--|--|
| Code Generation |	0.2 |	0.1 |	Generates code that adheres to established patterns and conventions. Output is more deterministic and focused. Useful for generating syntactically correct code.|
|Creative Writing |	0.7 |	0.8 |	Generates creative and diverse text for storytelling. Output is more exploratory and less constrained by patterns.|
|Chatbot Responses |	0.5 |	0.5 |	Generates conversational responses that balance coherence and diversity. Output is more natural and engaging.|
|Code Comment Generation |	0.3 |	0.2 |	Generates code comments that are more likely to be concise and relevant. Output is more deterministic and adheres to conventions.|
|Data Analysis Scripting |	0.2 |	0.1 |	Generates data analysis scripts that are more likely to be correct and efficient. Output is more deterministic and focused.|
|Exploratory Code Writing |	0.6 |	0.7 |	Generates code that explores alternative solutions and creative approaches. Output is less constrained by established patterns.|

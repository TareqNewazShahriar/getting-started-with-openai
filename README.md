### Knowing the Models
* `davinci`: `davinci-...` *fine-tuning* models are very useful to use as chat agent. When trained or fine-tuned with some plain instruction or data, it plays the role as instructed.

### Important Links
* Text generation Models Api documentation: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation
* OpenAI API Parameters descriptions: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create
* API Documentation link on Fine-tuning: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning
* Deprecated models: https://platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations

### Notes
* To give you an idea of how `temperature` and `Top_p` parameters can be used in different scenarios, hereâ€™s a table with example values:

| Use Case |	Temperature |	Top_p |	Description
|---|--|--|--|
| Code Generation |	0.2 |	0.1 |	Generates code that adheres to established patterns and conventions. Output is more deterministic and focused. Useful for generating syntactically correct code.|
|Creative Writing |	0.7 |	0.8 |	Generates creative and diverse text for storytelling. Output is more exploratory and less constrained by patterns.|
|Chatbot Responses |	0.5 |	0.5 |	Generates conversational responses that balance coherence and diversity. Output is more natural and engaging.|
|Code Comment Generation |	0.3 |	0.2 |	Generates code comments that are more likely to be concise and relevant. Output is more deterministic and adheres to conventions.|
|Data Analysis Scripting |	0.2 |	0.1 |	Generates data analysis scripts that are more likely to be correct and efficient. Output is more deterministic and focused.|
|Exploratory Code Writing |	0.6 |	0.7 |	Generates code that explores alternative solutions and creative approaches. Output is less constrained by established patterns.|

* How to request for JSON response
  1. On initial system message, instruct to produce JSON. E.g. "Please wrap you asnwer in well formatted JSON.".
  2. Also use `response_format` parameter. `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }`.
